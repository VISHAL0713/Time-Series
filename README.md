# Time-Series Documentation and Coding

##Q. What is Time Series?
Ans - A time series is a sequence of data points recorded in time order, typically at regular intervals. These data points can represent anything that's observed over time, such as:

- **Stock prices**
- **Weather measurements**
- **Economic indicators**
- **Sales figures**

The primary goal of time series analysis is to understand the underlying patterns and trends to make predictions about future data points. By examining the data over time, you can identify patterns such as trends, seasonal effects, and cycles.
